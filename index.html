                    <p>
                        Hello fellow traveller! We represent a set of independent users in this
                        new technological frontier. We believe the internet will grow to be a
                        powerful thing, and we don't believe government involvement will be a net
                        positive for its success.
                    </p>

                <div class="content-box">
                    <p>TODO: The rest of the argument will go here.</p>
                    <p>Here's what needs to get done:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Complete an argument. Doesn't have to be something you actually believe
                            in, but don't make it obviously flawed. Our argument is that government
                            involvement in the internet will stifle its users' independence.
                        </li>

                            Generate assets for this project. My reference for this website is
                            <a href="https://odditycommoddity.neocities.org/" target="_blank">this NeoCities page</a>
                            (cool site btw). I think having colorful patterned backgrounds and
                            obnoxious gifs are a good touch here.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Make more content to stuff the page with. We'll leave the website to
                            exactly one page, but it'd be cool if there's extra stuff on this page.
                            I've already got a few things here, but there's more to do.
                        </li>

                    <p>
                        We'll have to avoid merge conflicts of course. Try not to delete this box
                        until stuff's done.

                    Obviously, we didn't get paid to make this argument. The year is 2025 and we're
                    pretty sure dial-up is a thing of the past. Take most of the things on this page
                    with a grain of salt.
